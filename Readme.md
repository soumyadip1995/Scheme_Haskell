### Scheme in Haskell
#### Why Haskell 

Languages such as C/C++ are imperative in the sense, they provide a sequence of actions. Functional programming languages such as haskell evaluate expressions instead of evaluating sequential instructions. Simply put, haskell can reach a stage of functional abstraction(In functional abstraction, details of the algorithms to accomplish the function are not visible to the consumer of the function. The consumer of the function need to only know the correct calling convention and have trust in the accuracy of the functional results) that imperative languages cannot without adding more keywords and also not being able to get rid of sequencing.

#### Why scheme

Scheme's main advantages are elegance (the entire language can be built on top of a handful of primitive list manipulating operations).Scheme is perfect for functional abstraction. Although modern programming follows C/Algo style, Lisp syntax is simple, using the same syntax to represent code and data: the list. This is called homoiconicity, a feature which makes both parsing and evaluation much simpler compared to other languages. Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, is particularly straight-forward.
